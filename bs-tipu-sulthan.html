					<li><strong>20 November 1750</strong> - Born in Devanahalli, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.</li><br>
					<li>Tipu Sultan (born Sultan Fateh Ali Sahab Tipu, 20 November 1750 – 4 May 1799), also known as the Tipu Sahib, was a ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore. </li><br>
					<li>He was the eldest son of Sultan Hyder Ali of Mysore.</li><br>
					<li>Tipu introduced a number of administrative innovations during his rule, including his coinage, a new Mauludi lunisolar calendar, and a new land revenue system which initiated the growth of the Mysore silk industry.</li><br>
					<li>
						He expanded the iron-cased Mysorean rockets and commissioned the military manual Fathul Mujahidin, and is considered a pioneer in the use of rocket artillery.
					</li><br>
					<li>
						He deployed the rockets against advances of British forces and their allies during the Anglo-Mysore Wars, including the Battle of Pollilur and Siege of Seringapatam.
				    </li><br>
					<li>
						  He also embarked on an ambitious economic development program that established Mysore as a major economic power, with some of the world's highest real 
						   wages and living standards in the late 18th century.
						 </li><br>
						   <strong><u><h2>Childhood</u></strong><br><br></h2>
						 <li>
						   Tipu Sultan was born on 20 November 1750 (Friday, 20th Dhu al-Hijjah, 1163 AH) at Devanahalli, in present-day Bangalore Rural district, about 33 km (21 mi) north of Bangalore city.
						 </li><br>
						 <li>
						   He was named "Tipu Sultan" after the saint Tipu Mastan Aulia of Arcot. 
						 </li><br>
						 <li>
						   Tipu was also called "Sultan Sayyid walShareef Fateh Ali Khan Tipu" after his grandfather Fath Muhammad.
						 </li><br>
						 <li>
						   Tipu was born at Devanhalli in a Najeeb AlTarfayn Sayyid family meaning having ancestry to both Imams Hassan and Hussain, as the son of Hyder Ali. Being illiterate, Hyder was very particular in giving his eldest son a prince's education and a very early exposure to military and political affairs.
						 </li><br>
						 <li>
						   From the age of 17 Tipu was given independent charge of important diplomatic and military missions.
						 </li><br>
						 <li>
							He was his father's right arm in the wars from which Hyder emerged as the most powerful ruler of southern India.
						 </li><br><br>
						   <strong><h2><u>Foreign relations</u></strong></h2><br><br>
						 <li>
						   Both Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan were independent rulers of Mysore, but claimed some degree of loyalty to the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II. </li><br>
						
						  <li> Both of them are known to have maintained correspondence with the Mughal emperor.</li><br>
						   <li> Unlike the Nawab of Carnatic, neither owed any allegiance to the Nizam of Hyderabad and often instead chose direct contact and relations with the Mughal emperor.</li></h2><br><br>
						   
						   <h2><u>The Invasion of Malabar by Sultanate of Mysore (1766–1790)</u></h2><br><br>
						   <li> In 1766, when Tipu Sultan was just 15 years old, he got the chance to apply his military training in battle for the first time, when he accompanied his father on an invasion of Malabar.  </li><br>
						   <li> After the incident- Siege of Tellicherry in Thalassery in North Malabar, Hyder Ali started losing his territories in Malabar.</li><br>
						   <li> After the Battle of the Nedumkotta (1789–90), due to the monsoon flood, the stiff resistance of the Travancore forces and news about the attack of British in Srirangapatnam he went back.</li><br><br>
						  <h2><u>Death</u></h2><br><br>
						   <li>Horatio Nelson defeated François-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers at the Battle of the Nile in Egypt in 1798. Three armies marched into Mysore in 1799—one from Bombay and two British, one of which included Arthur Wellesley. </li><br>
						   <li> They besieged the capital Srirangapatna in the Fourth Mysore War.</li><br>
						   <li>There were more than 26,000 soldiers of the British East India Company, approximately 4,000 Europeans and the rest Indians. </li><br>
						   <li>A column was supplied by the Nizam of Hyderabad consisting of ten battalions and more than 16,000 cavalry, and many soldiers were sent by the Marathas. </li><br>
						   <li>  Thus, the soldiers in the British force numbered more than 50,000, whereas Tipu Sultan had only about 30,000.</li><br>
						   <li> The British broke through the city walls, and French military advisers told Tipu Sultan[citation needed] to escape via secret passages, but he replied,  Tipu Sultan died defending his capital on 4 May.</li><br>
